# GAME MECHANICS

## MAIN MECHANICS

In this game, you will act as a spaceman who transports to the grassland or the castle.
In the grassland, you'll meet some enemies you're able to fight.
Tn the castle, you'll meet a boss you feel it difficult to fight.
He battles against enemies and upgrades after winning.
When the game starts, you will begin at LV1. 
The maximum level of you is LV6.

You're born at a spacelab.
Chat to the Purple NPC to go to the grassland or the castle.
Once you exit the spacelab, you'll not return until battle ends.
Whether you win or lose in a battle, you'll reborn in the spacelab.

Before you upgrade to the maximum level, every time you win will award you 30 EXP.
Every 100 EXP you get will get you upgrade for 1 grade.
If your EXP is not less than 699, your EXP will be 699, because it's the maximum EXP you're able to get.

## IN A BATTLE

In a battle, you have 3 different techniques: Common attack, Swich forms, and Release end technique.
You can switch between ice form and fire form, to give ice attack and fire attack.
Once the enemy got both two forms of attacks, it will be weaker and easier to lose more HP when you attack.
Each time you use one of the first two techniques, you'll restore one TP.
Each time you release end technique, you will use 5 TP.
You can have at most 5 TP at a time.

Likely, the enemy has 3 different techniques: Common attack, Restore HP, and Release end technique.
Each time it uses one of the first two techniques, you'll restore one TP.
Each time it releases end technique, you will use 5 TP.
It can have at most 5 TP at a time.
It will be cauculated by AI and AI will give out the best thing to do.

After you win a battle, you'll be awarded with coins.
Coins are the most important currency of the game.
The higher level the enemies are, the more coins you'll get after defeating them.

## CHATTING WITH NPCS

You can chat with the Green NPC to use coins to upgrade your sword.
You initially have a bronze sword, and you can upgrade it to an iron sword, a steel sword, a gold sword, a crystal sword, and finally a nether alloy sword.

As you upgrade yourself and your sword, you'll meet stronger enemies in the grassland.
If you upgrade your sword to the maximum level and upgrade yourself to LV6, you'll meet LV8 enemies in the grassland, which are the most powerful common enemies.
The boss of the castle is fixed to LV10, which is the maximum level of enemies in the game.
You'll never defeat he boss ... or you 'll press F3 to cheat?

You can also chat with the Banana NPC to use coins to buy foods.
The foods will gove yiu buffs as the instructions said.
The buffs given by foods can only last one battle.
Some of them enhance your attack, some enhance your defence, and some deducts HP but makes it easier to release end technique.

You can also chat with the Yellow NPC to use coins to game on the spaceships.
You may win more coins if you choose the correct spaceship.

If you don't know which spaceship to choose, ask the Machine NPC.
It runs by AI and will give you clues.
Meanwhile, it can also give instructions on how to apply LLM to game programming.
Chatting with it will always make you impressed.
